Personally, I know around 4 programming languages (Python, Java, Lua, C++) with a bit of Pseudocode because of IB and IGCSES. Hopefully these wikis will help you all learn them. 

Remember that learnind coding languages are like learning languages, they're hard and will take time for you to learn. So make sure you practice your coding frequently along with your math skills.

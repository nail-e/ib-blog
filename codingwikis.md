Personally, I know around 4 programming languages (Python, Java, Lua, C++) with a bit of Pseudocode because of IB and IGCSES. Hopefully these wikis will help you all learn them. 

Remember that learnind coding languages are like learning languages, they're hard and will take time for you to learn. So make sure you practice your coding frequently along with your math skills.

### **[Python Wiki](https://nail-e.github.io/ib-site/python-wiki/)**
Python is a dynamically typed coding language that's really easy to learn and even easier to remember. Python has a lot of libraries and frameworks to help you code your dream program. Python is really popular as evidenced by just us learning how to code in Python in GCSE and IB.

### IB Pseudocode Wiki<!---(https://nail-e.github.io/ib-site/ib-pseudocode-wiki/)--> (Under Construction)

IB Pseudocode is pseudocode based on Java that incorporates features from other languages in order to teach us IB students as much fundemental concepts of programming in IB. IB Pcode can be easily converted to and from Python if you're finding and difficulty in learning it.

### **[Java Wiki](https://nail-e.github.io/ib-site/java-wiki/)**
Java is quite a senior programming language embedded in everything we use daily. Java is an object oriented programming language that stresses the use of classes and objects. Luckily for us, we don't need Java in IB but it is still a useful language to know.

### Lua Wiki <!---(https://nail-e.github.io/ib-site/lua-wiki/)--> (Under Construction)
Lua strikes a sentimental chord in my heart as it was the first programming language I learnt while playing Roblox. Lua is a scripting language much like Python but is more specialized in the sense that it can be embedded in other languages to have use in scripting.

### Brainfuck (BF) Wiki <!---(https://nail-e.github.io/ib-site/brainfuck-wiki/)--> (Under Construction)
An oddly named language, this is one of the few programming languages I'm going to analyze in my Extended Essay. 296 bytes in length, this simple languages is an absolute mindfuck to get your head around.
